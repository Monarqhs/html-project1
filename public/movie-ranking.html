<h1>The Best Movies According to Ghalih</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>I really enjoy this movie, as it conveys that planting ideas is the most powerful weapon humans possess.</p>

<h3>Kimi no Nawa</h3>
<p>This is one of Makoto Shinkai's finest films, with exceptional art quality and a touching story</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan's new film takes me back to the dark history of the atomic bomb and is quite informative in expanding my historical knowledge about what transpired during World War II.</p>
